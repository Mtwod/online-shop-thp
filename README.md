## What is the Kitten Shop?
This project was one of two final projects 

This is an online shop selling cute kitten pictures. Customers can sign up, sign in, put their favourite pictures in their cart, and pay. 


## Objectives of this project

The main objectives of this project were to:
* learn the importance of the agile methodology and comprehend its importance when it comes to teamwork
* realize that after 10 weeks of learning programming, we are able to create

## How to open the website

The quickest and easiest way to do it would be to open it on Heroku: 

Or you can run the following commands in your terminal:

1) Clone this repository 
```shell
$ git clone
```

2) Prepare the initialization of the repository
```shell
$ bundle install
```

```shell
$ rails db:create
```

```shell
$ rails db:migrate
```

```shell
$ rails db:seed
```

3) Run the app in your server
```shell
$ rails server
```

4) Now all you need to do is open it in your faborite browser


This is a rather minimalist version of the shop. We could have implemented countless features, but the point of this project was to deliver an MVP version in just 4 days time.
